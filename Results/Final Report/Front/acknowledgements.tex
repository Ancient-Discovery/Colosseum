\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
Firstly, I would like to appreciate my supervisor Dr. Ruihai Dong for bringing me into deep learning domain, a fast-growing AI field with huge opportunities. During the whole semester, his continuous support made me accomplish the entire research project.

Secondly, I really thank UCD school of Computer Science for partially covering fares of our team on-the-spot field study in Anyang, Henan Province, from April 4 to 5, 2018. Also, I want to express huge thank to my uncle Yanjun Ren who introduced us plenty of local connection, which provided a few academic help from them.

Eventually, I finalise my acknowledgements by appreciating highly efficient collaboration with my other team members for nearly four months, Lin Lyu and LuLu Wang; especially my ex-girlfriend Lin, who supported me a lot previously and made the break-up much less nasty.
