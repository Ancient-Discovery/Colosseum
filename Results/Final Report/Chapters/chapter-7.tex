\chapter{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we collected more than 100 thousand ancient Chinese character images, processed them in a suitable and well-considered fashion. Then we applied CNN on recognition tasks and achieved relatively acceptable results compared to traditional ones. Eventually GAN, a neural network technique with data generation feature, gave us feedbacks of Bronze-script-like / modern-Chinese-character-like images by inputting oracle bone script characters into our programs.
